# CV/Resume Feedback (OpenAI)

**IMPORTANT: This program sends the contents of the job posting and resume files to OpenAI for processing. Please ensure that these files do not contain any sensitive information that you do not wish to share with OpenAI. The author of this program is not responsible for any misuse of the program and provides it AS-IS, without any warranty or assumption of responsibility.**

This program is a contribution to the ISACA community to assist with job searches. It uses the OpenAI API to generate recommendations for improving a resume based on a given job posting. It reads a job posting and a resume from text files, sends them to the OpenAI API, and writes the recommendations to another text file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- pip
- OpenAI, numpy, and pandas Python packages
- OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Obtain an API key from OpenAI.

3. Open the `config.ini` file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain your OpenAI API key and the names of the job posting, resume, and recommendations files. Here's an example:

    ```ini
    [DEFAULT]
    API_KEY = your_api_key_here
    JOB_POSTING_FILE = job_posting.txt
    RESUME_FILE = resume.txt
    RECOMMENDATIONS_FILE = recommendations.txt
    ```

4. Open the `job_posting.txt` file in the root directory of the project and paste the job posting information.

5. Open the `resume.txt` file in the root directory of the project and paste the resume information.

## Running the Program

1. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project.

2. Run the `main.py` script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The program will read the job posting and resume, send them to the OpenAI API, and write the recommendations to the `recommendations.txt` file (or whatever file name you specified in the `config.ini` file).

## Output

The program will create a text file (by default, `recommendations.txt`) containing the recommendations generated by the OpenAI API. You can open this file to view the recommendations.
