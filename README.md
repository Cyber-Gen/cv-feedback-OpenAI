# CV/Resume Feedback (OpenAI)

**IMPORTANT: This program shares the contents of job posting and resume files with OpenAI for processing. Please ensure that these files do not contain any sensitive information that you do not wish to be processed by OpenAI.

This program is a contribution to the ISACA community to assist with members job search. It uses the OpenAI API to generate recommendations for improving a resume based on a given job posting.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- pip
- OpenAI, numpy, and pandas Python packages
- OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Obtain an API key from OpenAI.

3. Create and open the `config.ini` file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain your OpenAI API key and the names of the job posting, resume, and recommendations files. You can adjust the GPT model if you wish. Here's an example:

    ```ini
    [DEFAULT]
    GPT_MODEL = gpt-4o-mini
    API_KEY = your_api_key_here
    JOB_POSTING_FILE = job_posting.txt
    RESUME_FILE = resume.txt
    RECOMMENDATIONS_FILE = recommendations.txt
    ```

4. Open the `job_posting.txt` file in the root directory of the project and paste the job posting information.

5. Open the `resume.txt` file in the root directory of the project and paste the resume information.

## Running the Program

1. Open terminal in the root directory of the project.

2. Run the `cv-feedback.py` script:

    ```bash
    python cv-feedback.py
    ```

3. The program will read the job posting and resume, send them to the OpenAI, and write the recommendations to the `recommendations.txt` file (or whatever file name you specified in the `config.ini` file).

## Output

The program will create a text file (by default, `recommendations.txt`) containing the recommendations generated by the OpenAI API. You can open this file to view the recommendations.
